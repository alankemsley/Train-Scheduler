# MBTA Train Scheduler
## A web application for updating train information for the Boston T.

This application utilizes Google Firebase NoSQL database for storing departure times and other train information entered by the user. The app was written in JavaScript/jQuery, and uses the Materialize CSS framework based on Google's Material Design principles for front-end design.

This is a sample project, and is not associated with the MBTA.
